# Tesla Homepage Clone with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript

### This is a recreation of the Tesla homepage, built using the powerful combination of Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and sprinkles of JavaScript for interactivity.

#### Key Features:
<strong>1. Tailwind CSS:</strong> I leveraged the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS to achieve a clean and responsive layout that closely resembles the original Tesla homepage.

<strong>2. JavaScript:</strong> Implemented subtle JavaScript interactions to elevate the user experience, such as smooth scrolling, animations, and side navigation.

<strong>3. Learning Resource:</strong> Explore this project as a learning tool to get hands-on practice with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript for building modern web interfaces.

#### Including:
<li>Smooth Scrolling</li>
